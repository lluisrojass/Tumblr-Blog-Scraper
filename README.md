# Tumblr Personal Post Scraper

This application has been archived. 

Tumblr has modified their application's workflow to conceal necessary content identifiers necessary for this application's functions. I've also long felt this tool is too blunt to be useful. As a result i've written [Personal Post Highlighter for Tumblr](https://github.com/lluisrojass/tumblr-personal-post-highlighter), a chrome extension that highlights private content on an archive page itself.
